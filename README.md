# Angular Tech Talk - June 10, 2015

## Agenda

1. Go over what Angular is
  * MVC Framework for the front End
  * Allows for structure in the front end
  * One page apps – You’re making applications, not websites!
  
1. Go over jQuery vs Angular
  * jQuery is a library, Angular is a framework
  * jQuery is for DOM manipulating, Angular is for data manipulation
  
1. Modules… what are they?
  * angular.module(‘name’, []) for new
  * angular.module(‘name’) for adding to existing
  
4. Controllers - they control things.

5. {{}} MUSTACHES!

6. Scope, we all know it. Let’s see how it works in Angular.

7. Services – service controllers (models in a way).
  * Define API resource service
  * $http and promises
  * Define question and answer service
  
8. Directives – Define your own tags.
